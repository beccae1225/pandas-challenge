Based on my analysis of the data, I found the following data trends: 

1)	Although the majority of buyers are male (84%), purchasers that are female/non-disclosed have a higher average total per person than males at $4.47 per person compared to $4.07. While this might be attributed to the much higher male buyer count compared to females (484 vs. 81), it would be interesting to further compare the most profitable items by gender.
2)	Almost half of the purchases were made by users in the 20-24 age bin (46.79%). More than 75% of total purchases were made by users between the ages of 15-29. Knowing this, the store should cater more to games that appease this younger demographic. 
3)	At first glance, it does not appear that item price is correlated with total purchase value. Further analysis is required to determine if there is a relationship between price and total purchase value. It would also be interesting to determine if there is any relationship between video game genre and profitability.
